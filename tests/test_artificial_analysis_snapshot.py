"""Artificial Analysis: what the reshape had to decide, pinned.

The source arrived as three normalized tables joined by id. It is committed as
two denormalized CSVs in the llm-stats header vocabulary, reshaped by
`scripts/reshape_artificial_analysis.py`, and read by the same normalizer every
other crawl goes through. These tests pin the decisions that reshape made, so a
recrawl that quietly rejoins two metrics, respells a vendor, or renames an
already-published model fails here rather than on the site.
